		<xs:appinfo>SDMX Core Structure Specific Data Namespace Module</xs:appinfo>
		<xs:documentation>The core structure specific data namespace module provides the common framework to be used for all data structure definition-specific schemas for data exchange, update, and revisions. It is intended for bilateral use. This forms the basis for all sets of namespace modules created and maintained by those who create data structure definition-specific data schemas which are not maintained by SDMX. The data set defined here describes the structure of the data set in all structure specific data messages. Any structure specific data messages must derive the data set from this format. The entire structure declared for the is data set is abstract, meaning that instances will have to be based on types derived from these structures in schemas created based on the details data structure definition.</xs:documentation>

	<xs:complexType name="DataSetType" abstract="true">
		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>
				<p>DataSetType is the abstract type which defines the base structure for any data structure definition specific data set. A derived data set type will be created that is specific to a data structure definition and the details of the organisation of the data (i.e. which dimension is the observation dimension). Data is organised into either a collection of series (grouped observations) or a collection of un-grouped observations. The derived data set type will restrict this choice to be either grouped or un-grouped observations. If this dimension is "AllDimensions" then the derived data set type must consist of a collection of un-grouped observations; otherwise the data set will contain a collection of series with the observations in the series disambiguated by the specified dimension at the observation level. This data set is capable of containing data (observed values) and/or documentation (data and metadata attribute values) and can be used for incremental updates and deletions (i.e. only the relevant updates or deletes are exchanged). It is assumed that each series or un-grouped observation will be distinct in its purpose. For example, if series contains both data and documentation, it assumed that each series will have a unique key. If the series contains only data or only documentation, then it is possible that another series with the same key might exist, but with not with the same purpose (i.e. to provide data or documentation) as the first series.</p>

				<p>This base type is designed such that derived types can be processed in a generic manner; it assures that data structure definition specific data will have a consistent structure. The group, series, obs, and atts elements are unqualified, meaning that they are not qualified with a namespace in an instance. This means that in the derived data set types, the elements will always be the same, regardless of the target namespace of the schemas which defines these derived types. This allows for consistent processing of the structure without regard to what the namespace might be for the data structure definition specific schema.</p>

				<p>GroupType is the abstract type which defines a structure which is used to communicate attribute values for a group defined in a data structure definition. The group can consist of either a subset of the dimensions defined by the data structure definition, or an association to an attachment constraint, which in turn defines key sets to which attributes can be attached.

It is expected that a system which is processing this will relate that identifier to the key sets defined in the constraint and apply the values provided for the attributes appropriately.</p>

Both the dimension values which make up the key (if applicable) and the attribute values associated with the group will be represented with XML attributes.

The XML attributes will be given a name based on the attribute's identifier. These XML attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a namespace associated with them). The dimension XML attributes will be required while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML attributes in the derived group type be for the group dimensions and data or metadata attributes declared in the data structure definition. If additional attributes are required, these should be qualified with a namespace so that a generic application can easily distinguish them as not being meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or attribute.</p>
