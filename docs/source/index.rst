Introduction
------------

We are in the process of cleaning up, unifying and simplifying the repositories associated to the SDMX standard's formats, documentation, technical references, guidelines and examples. This is done in the context of the forthcomming version 3.0.0 of the SDMX standard ...

During this process we intend to regroup and simplify the access to the documentation of the standard.

Please bare with us whilst this is being executed. 

Progress will be visible in the :literal:`develop` and other branches of this repository.
