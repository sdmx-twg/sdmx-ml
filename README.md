# SDMX-ML format specification overview

This repository is used for maintaining the SDMX-ML messages specifications.

This includes:

- Normative documentation and XSD schemas for the SDMX-ML structure, data, metadata and registry interface messages
- Samples for structures, data and reference metadata
- Samples illustrating use cases including VTL, structure mapping and reference metadata in practice

The XML schemas are designed for general use as part of the standard. The sample schemas and XML instances intend to illustrate of how SDMX can be used.

All schema and samples files should be stored in a single local directory before use.

The current version is based on the SDMX Information Model 3.0.0.
